# SenseSation User Guide

## Getting the File

### Downloading It

You can use:

```sh
fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TavaresBaker/SenseSation/refs/heads/main/SenseSation.sh
```

### Copy/Pasting It

1. Go to the GitHub repo or any source where the script is hosted and copy it.
2. Log in to the web GUI and go to **Diagnostics > Edit File**.
3. You can also SSH into the firewall and create a file.
4. Paste the script into a blank file and save it.

## Running It

```sh
chmod +x SenseSation.sh
./SenseSation.sh
```

## Using It

A menu will appear resembling the original pfSense console menu. You can select various sub-scripts to assist in cleaning compromised boxes.

- Each option that removes or modifies files will back them up into a quarantined and zipped directory for **OPSEC** purposes.
- Some options require manual review. For example, the **webhook script** will highlight potential webhook entriesâ€”you must use discretion to determine what's malicious and whether to delete it.
- Others run automatically, such as the **restore file script**, which replaces the entire `/usr/local/www` directory to recover the GUI from red team modifications.

## Cleanup

When you are finnished using the script **delete it and any supporting files** but keep the quarantine and backup directories.
